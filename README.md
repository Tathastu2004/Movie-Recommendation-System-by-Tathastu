## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   - Loads and merges `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`.
   - Extracts and processes genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview for each movie.
   - Creates a "tags" field for each movie by combining all relevant text features.
   - Applies stemming and vectorization (Bag-of-Words) for efficient similarity search.

2. **Recommendation Engine:**  
   - Computes cosine similarity between movies based on their tags.
   - Given a movie title, returns the top 5 most similar movies.

3. **Web App (Streamlit):**  
   - Users can search by title, genre, or keyword.
   - Genre buttons allow quick browsing.
   - Movie posters and details are fetched live from TMDb.

   *(You can find these on [Kaggle TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata))*.

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
