## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   - Loads and merges `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`.
   - Extracts and processes genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview for each movie.
   - Creates a "tags" field for each movie by combining all relevant text features.
   - Applies stemming and vectorization (Bag-of-Words) for efficient similarity search.

2. **Recommendation Engine:**  
   - Computes cosine similarity between movies based on their tags.
   - Given a movie title, returns the top 5 most similar movies.

3. **Web App (Streamlit):**  
   - Users can search by title, genre, or keyword.
   - Genre buttons allow quick browsing.
   - Movie posters and details are fetched live from TMDb.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tathastu2004/Movie-Recommendation-System-by-Tathastu.git
   cd Movie-Recommendation-System-by-Tathastu
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file in the project root with your TMDb API credentials:**
   ```
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
   TMDB_BEARER_TOKEN=your_tmdb_bearer_token_here
   ```

4. **Download the datasets:**  
   Place `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` in the project root.  
   *(You can find these on [Kaggle TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata))*.

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit** - Web app framework
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **scikit-learn** - Machine learning and similarity calculations
- **TMDb API** - Movie posters and metadata
- **Python-dotenv** - Environment variable management
- **NLTK** - Natural language processing

---

## API Keys

This app uses the TMDb API for fetching posters.  
For production or heavy use, [get your own TMDb API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

**Note:** Create a `.env` file with your API credentials to keep them secure and out of version control.
